# ✨ Quest Completed: You've Found the _dkmhndr_ !

🛡️ Greetings, weary traveler! Welcome to the realm of the Code Alchemist! ⚔️

I am **Dika Mahendra**, the humble keeper of both the forge and the alchemy table in this digital kingdom.

In the fires of codecraft and the cauldron of data, I've honed my skills to become a masterful full-stack developer. Behold my arsenal of abilities:

**🐘 PHP in Laravel and CakePHP**\
As skilled as a blacksmith forging a blade, I craft robust web applications with these tools.\

**🧬 JavaScript and TypeScript with React and Vue**\
I wield the elements of the web, creating interactive user experiences that rival the grandest of quests.\

**☕ Java using Springboot and JPOS**\
Like a knight in shining armor, I champion the realm of server-side Java, ensuring reliability and security.\

**🎯 Dart using Flutter**\
Flutter, my trusty steed, carries me to the lands of cross-platform mobile app development.\

**📖 The Sacred Books of Vishanti Keeper**\
Within my sanctum lies a treasure trove of database knowledge such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server. I am the keeper of these databases, ensuring their integrity and unleashing their power for noble quests.
  
**💌 The Messenger's Guild**\
As a member of the Messenger's Guild, I have mastered the art of RPC using RabbitMQ. Like a swift carrier pigeon, I ensure seamless communication between realms in our digital kingdom.

## 🏰 Nerd Villager at JALA Tech 🦐
